jass-java
=========

jass-java is a pure Java virtual-machine for a custom language, based on [JASS (Just Another Scripting Syntax)]
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JASS) by Blizzard Entertainment. JASS is, of course, the property of Blizzard 
Entertainment.

jass-java uses many of the syntatic patterns from the original JASS specification. jass-java includes several syntax 
and behavior changes to make it more flexible and to increase the usability of the language.

Differences between jass and jass-java
--------------------------------------

* jass-java allows `handle`s to be cast upwards (ie, from `file` to `handle`).
* jass-java allows `handle`s to be cast back to their type if the type is actually what is specified (ie, `handle` 
  to `file` but only when the value is actually of type `file`).
* jass-java allows functions to be redeclared, including `native` functions, so long as they're not `constant` (see
  below).
* The use of `constant` has a different meaning in jass-java. `constant` in JASS meant that only other constant 
  functions or globals could be used in a constant scope. `constant` in jass-java means that variables, functions or 
  globals may not be redeclared or have their value changed.
* jass-java allows `code` and `handle` arrays, JASS doesn't.
* jass-java has no restriction on the size of an array, JASS arrays are limited to 8192.
* jass-java allows the catching of errors (exceptions) in user code.

Native Java & jass-java interoperability
----------------------------------------

### Types and values
jass-java allows Java objects to interact with JASS scripts and allows JASS scripts to work with Java objects as if 
they were JASS native values.

jass-java represents all non-JASS native types (eg, types not `boolean`, `integer`, `real`, `string` or `code`) as 
`handle`. jass-java does this by wrapping the object in a value container which the user-script sees as a `handle`. 
The user cannot use a jass-java script to directly access the object, it's methods or fields. Instead, native methods 
must be declared tyo handle this behaviour. 

Programmers whom are providing Java objects to jass-java should notify the `TypeRegistry` of their object's class 
and the name of the type so that jass-java can allow the user to perform operations on the type through native methods 
(as if it were being accessed in Java).

If jass-java does not know the native VM name of a Java object, jass-java will treat the object as a raw `handle` 
and will not allow the user to cast the object or perform actions with the `handle` unless functions in jass-java 
permit the passing of generic `handle`-typed values.

### Native methods
jass-java allows Java classes to grant access to their methods as if they were jass-java methods - these pseudo-
functions are dubbed 'native functions' and are declared in a jass-java script using the `native` keyword. Native 
functions behave as one would expect - they represent real references to JVM methods. jass-java requires the user 
know about the native function's signature. The user must have 'declared' the native function in their source before 
a native function can be used. The native function signature is not immutable.

When the user invokes a native function, the VM asks the `NativeMethodRegistry` for a JVM method which matches the 
name and signature of the invoked method. If the method's signature matches, the method will be invoked.

If a native method matching the signature cannot be found, an exception will be generated and passed to the user's 
script.

If a native method throws an exception, the exception will be passed to the user. If the native method returns a value, 
the value will be transformed to a value which jass-java can pass back to the user's script.

The `NativeMethodRegistry` provides an `registerNativeMethodProvider` method, which allows developers to 
register classes which provide methods with the `NativeMethod` annotation attached. Native methods must accept at 
least one parameter; a `Callout` object is provided to the native method so that the method can read and write local 
variables or access the virtual machine's instance.

Stack frames and Closures
-------------------------

jass-java uses `Closure`s to contain it's upvalues. The order of reference in a Closure is as follows:

1. The local closure (the function scope)
2. The run closure (the thread scope)
3. The global closure (the globals)

All statements and expressions are evaluated into one or more sub-types of the `VMStackFrame` class. The use of 
stack-frames in such a manner allows the virtual machine to step forwards with absolute precision and allows the 
interruption of stepping without the use of Java threads.

User code cannot access the stack frame of the current thread. Java code can read and write to the stack frame of any 
thread, but any such behavior may result in unexpected and unspecified behavior.

Exceptions and errors
---------------------
jass-java gives scripts the ability to perform try-catch blocks. They also behave exactly as expected; if the script 
statements inside the try block fail, the catch block is executed.

As jass-java has no concept of an 'exception' or 'error' type, the catch block cannot filter the type of error. The 
catch block can access the error string, but cannot access the exception or error itself.

jass-java does not allow VM internal errors to be caught, as VM errors are considered to be an unrecoverable problem 
and so the user shouldn't expect the VM to continue after a VM error occurs.

Threading
---------
jass-java allows the creation, destruction and running of user threads. User threads consist of functions which take 
`nothing` and return `nothing`. User threads are executed alongside the main thread until either:

1. The thread ends gracefully;
2. The code in the thread throws an exception; or
3. The VM decides that it is no longer possible or viable to run the thread (such as consuming too many resources, 
   being interrupted or cancelled by another thread or taking too much 'cpu time').

Any thread may create a child thread and commit it to the thread heap, and any thread can cancel the execution of any 
thread - with the exception of the main thread. The user can also ask the system for the status of any thread object.

Once a thread has ended, it (and it's object representation) may not be restarted.

### Thread safety

jass-java has no native concept of thread safety. Reading and writing variables should be considered an atomic 
(immediate) operation and thus any changes to values take place instantaneously.

As only one thread actually executes concurrently, there is no requirement for common synchronization objects (mutex 
or otherwise). Programmers working in threaded contexts should be aware of the state of their objects (ie, not 
accessing null variables, etc).

### Thread scheduling

jass-java allows Java code to manage and adjust the speed at which the interpreter executes operations waiting on the 
stack. 

The `ThreadSchedule` defines a particular `Scheduler` schedule mode (see below) and a number of cycles in the mode. 
The scheduler can be modified at any time during the operation of the VM, but changes to the effective number of cycles 
per thread will only take effect on the next machine update.

The `Scheduler` enumeration declares two modes of operation; one where the number of cycles specified applies to the 
whole VM (and thus time is shared between all threads) or a mode where the number of cycles is applied to each thread 
(and thus the total number of cycles is cycles * no_of_threads).
