jass-java
=========

jass-java is a pure Java virtual-machine for a custom language, based on the original [JASS (Just Another Scripting 
Syntax)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JASS) lexical specification by Blizzard Entertainment. The original JASS 
specification is, of course, the property of Blizzard Entertainment.

jass-java uses many of the syntatic patterns from the original JASS specification. It includes several syntax and 
behavior changes and additions to make it more flexible and to increase the usability of the language.
